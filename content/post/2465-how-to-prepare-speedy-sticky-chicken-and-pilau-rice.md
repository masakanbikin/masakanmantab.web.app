recipeinstructions:

I left it to simmer until the rice went fluffy and fluffed it with a fork."
- "At the same time as the rice was simmering, I lined a baking tray with greaseproof paper and put the chicken thighs into a hot oven for approx 8 mins. Then turned them over to skin side up and brushed over my homemade mango jam then popped them back to the oven for another 10/12 mins until bubbling and sticky. I served the chicken on top of the rice and sprinkled with fresh parsley and a lemon wedge. It was gorgeous!!"
