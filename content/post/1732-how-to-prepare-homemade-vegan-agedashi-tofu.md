recipeinstructions:
- "Gently drain the tofu and place on kitchen paper. You canâ€™t press in the same way as you would a firmed tofu as itâ€™s really delicate. Cut into cubes."
- "Prepare the sauce by using a little dashi stock (you will need to prepare this in advance by soaking and lightly simmering the shiitake and seaweed) and boiling in a pan with soy sauce or ponzu and a few punches of sugar.
