My favorite way to use it is on bread though with lots of fresh herbs. I didn&#39;t use nearly as much fresh herbs in these pictures as I actually. I always used to love cottage cheese and I only just found a good vegan alternative. Most vegan recipes use silken tofu, but I much prefer this version with regular firm tofu and unsweetened soy yogurt. It is has exactly the right texture and a lovely slightly savory, salty and sour flavor.
