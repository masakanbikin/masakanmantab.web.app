- "3/4 Cup All Purpose Flour"
- "3/4 Cup Whole Wheat Flour"
- "1   1/2 Teaspoons Baking Powder"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Salt"
- "1/2 Cup Flaxseed"

- "1 Eggwhite"
- "2 Tablespoons Honey"
- " Maple Syrup"
- " Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine flours, baking powder, baking soda, spices, flaxseed and salt in a large bowl, preferably strained through a sieve as this will make pancakes lighter and fluffier. Stir together."
- "Combine buttermilk, oil, honey,1 egg, and the egg white, stirring with a whisk; add to flour mixture, stirring just until moist. (Mixture should be runny, almost like a thick milkshake consistency)"
- "Heat a pan and add some butter, enough to cover the base of the pan.For the savoury recipe i make a larger, thicker pancake. Cook the pancake on one side, checking to turn once it is a golden brown. Flip pancake over, allow to cook for just a few seconds."
- "Take off the heat and with a butter knife cut a large heart shape out of the centre. The pancake should be cooked solidly enough to allow this. Return to a medium heat, add a little drop of oil to the centre, and break an egg into the centre."
- "To cook the top of the egg i like to stick the pan under a grill flame/broiler for a minute. Then place your pancake onto the plate and serve how you would like; In the picture I have sauteed some mushrooms, grilled some turkey bacon, and poured some syrup on the plate. Voila!"
- "For the sweet plate (pictured) I heat the pan as before, melt some butter, and slowly pour two lines of pancakes that meet at the bottom to form a heart shape. Once the pancake is cooked, you can use a butter knife to perfect the heart shape!"
- "For the sweet pancake i decorated the plate by arranging pomegranate seeds around one pancake, whipped cream and cinnamon on top of another, sliced bananas and maple syrup on the plate, and a serving of strawberries, blueberries and almonds on the side, but be creative and use anything youd like!"
