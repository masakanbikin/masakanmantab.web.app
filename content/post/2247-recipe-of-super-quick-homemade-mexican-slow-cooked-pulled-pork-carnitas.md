It&#39;s traditionally made with pork shoulder (also known as pork butt) because of the higher fat content, which helps the meat stay super tender and juicy while it&#39;s cooked. It can be used to make tacos (as pictured in the photos in this post), tostadas, salads. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Return the shredded pork to the crock pot and Carnitas means &#39;little meats&#39; and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are.
