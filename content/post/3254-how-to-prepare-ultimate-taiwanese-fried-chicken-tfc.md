recipeinstructions:

- "Pour cooking oil at least one inch deep into pot or wok being used for frying and turn to medium high heat. In a small bowl, crack and gently beat the egg. In a large food bag, put in the plain flour or cornstarch and the potato flour."
- "When the oil is hot enough (between 160-180 degrees), tip: place the end of the chopstick into the oil, if it bubbles the oil is ready. Coat all of the chicken in the egg mixture, once fully coated, dip each chicken piece into the flour mixture. Coat evenly all over and then place into hot oil. Let chicken fry on both sides until it becomes golden brown (about 3-4 minutes)."

- "Once all of the chicken has been cooked, transfer to a large mixing bowl. Then going back to the oil place in handful fresh basil leaves. Tip: Be careful as the oil will splatter if basil leaves have any extra moisture of water in it and may make a popping sound. The basil leaves cook quite fast, so you only need to fry them for a few seconds. Remove once crispy. Place basil leaves on baking tray lined with a paper towel to remove excess oil."
- "Now go back to the chicken and add the crispy basil leaves. Now dust generously with the Taiwanese pepper salt. Shake the bowl and toss the chicken gently to coat every piece of it. Serve immediately while pipping hot. Eat it as a snack or as a side dish accompaniment with other dishes."
