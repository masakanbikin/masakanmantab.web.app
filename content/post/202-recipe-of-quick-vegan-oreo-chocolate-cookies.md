This means small amounts of milk may have come into contact with the cookies or the equipment used to make. If Oreos are free of the milk, cream, animal fat, milk fat, and butter and other animal products expected in cookies, that would make them vegan, right… As for that last one, despite being a chocolate cookie sandwich filled with cream, turns out there are no animal products used in the production of.. Crunchy chocolate cookie and sweet delicious cream center. These cookies were a labor of love to get just right, but I would not be deterred. Oreo cookies do not contain any animal-derived ingredients and are safe to eat for vegans.
