recipeingredient:
- " The dumplings"
- "75 g beef suet"
- "150 g self raising flour"
- "1 pinch salt"
- " Roughly 3 tablespoons water"
- " The strew"
- "10 sausages or thereabouts"
- "1 teaspoon lard mine was homemade from beef bones can use oil"
- "1 carrot chopped small"
- "1 onion chopped small"
- "1 celery stick chopped small"
- "3 cabbage leaves roughly chopped"
- "1/2 bell pepper chopped small"
- " Water or a meaty stock"
- "1 beef stock cube not needed if you use a stock"
- "1 teaspoon bovril"
- "1 desert spoon of savory"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 handful peas"
- "1 desert spoon Hendersons relish"
- "1/2 teaspoon English mustard"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat the oven to 180°c or 350°f"
- "To make the dumplings; combine suet, flour and salt in a bowl and mix well"
- "Add the liquid and mix until it becomes firm and pliable. Roll into balls a bit smaller than golf balls (can be even smaller if you prefer). We made 7 but your amount may vary"
- "For the stew; in the pan/pot you&#39;re going to cook the stew in, melt your lard. Once the lard is melted, add the sausages and put in the oven for roughly 20 minutes or until cooked fully (make sure what you use is oven safe)."
- "Whilst the sausages are cooking, use this time to chop your veg (if you only have say 4 sausages, feel free to also add some potato&#39;s to the veg). You can also make the dumplings at this point if you&#39;re a fast chopper."
- "Once the sausages are done, take them out of the oven and place on a plate to cool down."
- "Put the pan on your hob and saute the carrots and onion in the leftover lard/sausage fat until the onions are golden brown. Halfway through you can deglaze the pan with either water or red wine but it&#39;s completely up to you"
- "Once the sausages have cooled enough to hold easily, cut into diagonal pieces (this could be before or after step 9. Whenever you feel you have the time to look away from the pan for a second)"
- "Add the remaining veg to the pan and saute for a further 5 minutes."
- "Add sausage, savory, and garlic powder. Make sure everything is well mixed and cook for a further couple minutes"
- "Then add the water (boiling would be best, just makes everything quicker), stock cube, Hendersons relish, bovril, mustard, and peas. Mix well and allow to come to a boil"
- "Once the water is boiling, add your dumplings. Once one side has been cooking for a few minutes, roll them over and let the other side cook. You can repeat this process as much as you feel necessary."
- "Let the stew cook for roughly 20-40 minutes still on high heat until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. (If you added potato&#39;s, make sure they&#39;re fully cooked)."
- "When you feel it&#39;s ready, serve. You can add additional black pepper or fresh parsley for garnish if you like. Enjoy"
