In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onions until softened. Then add the ground beef and cook until the beef is cooked through. Some burrito purists insist that burritos should not be prepared with rice at all, and others insist that lettuce on a burrito is an anathema. Leftover cooked rice should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature or it may grow bacteria. It should be refrigerated and used within four to six.
