recipeingredient:
- "2 tuna steaks"
- "1 cup pistachio without shell"
- "1/2 cup breadcrumbs"
- " Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the pistachio very thin, you can use a knife of a half moon blade, I wouldn’t use a mixer as it will turn in into a paste instead but that’s personal preference. Add the breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and set aside on a large plate ready to rub our tuna in. You can also add some lemon zest at this point."
- "Take the tuna steaks and rub some oil on it with your hands to help the pistachio crumbs sticking to it. Press them onto the pistachio and breadcrumbs mix on both side pressing gently with your fingers."
- "Heat a pan on very high heat with a bit of olive oil, and when it starts to bubble add the steaks. Ours were particularly thick, about 2 cm high so we cooked them 1.5 min per side. If yours are thinner 1min per side is enough, remember we want to keep it raw inside or it will go tough and as we say in Italy ‘you’ll kill him twice the poor thing’."
- "Remove from the pan and cut the steak into chunks. Serve immediately"
