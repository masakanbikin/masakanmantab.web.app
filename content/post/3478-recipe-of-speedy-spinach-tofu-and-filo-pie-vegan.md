recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up 2 table spoons of olive oil. Add the finely chopped leek and cook for a few minutes, until soft."
- "Add the garlic, paprika and spinach (it helps to add to add a handful at a time). Cook down until it is very soft, stirring constantly (for about 5 minutes). When it is cooked leave to cool. You might need to press some of the liquid out of the spinach if it is very runny, I recommend you keep the liquid in case you need it later (it has lots of flavour)."

- "Pre-heat the oven to 190c (gas mark 5). Grease a tin and line it with filo pastry, you can brush a little olive oil between the pastry sheets. When you get halfway add the spinach mixture. Spread it so the mix is a few centimetres from the edge. Add the remaining pastry on top and brush with the remaining oil."
- "Bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes, until the filling is piping hot the pasty is golden-brown."
