Those noodles were so. damn. good. Add the drained rice noodles, prepared sauce, and fried tofu cubes back to the skillet. Carefully stir and toss the contents of the skillet until everything is As a food lover and a number cruncher I&#39;ve decided that cooking on a budget shouldn&#39;t mean canned beans and ramen noodles night after night. Arrange the vegetables, tofu and dumplings onto the noodles. Ladle the curry broth but do not overfill as this coconut curry broth is.
