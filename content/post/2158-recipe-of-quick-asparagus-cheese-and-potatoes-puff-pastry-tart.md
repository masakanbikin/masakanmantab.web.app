It was only after I made that first time that I found out how easy it is. If you don&#39;t want to make a crust, you can use phyllo dough or a store bought crust or frankly you could sprinkle parmesan cheese generously over a buttered baking. Place the puff pastry onto it and roll it out to a large rectangle. Make the rectangle as high as an asparagus is long and as wide as you want. Scatter the cheese and parsley filling on top of the potato slices.
