Butter chicken was first created in India just a few decades ago, and was actually born out of a need to re-purpose unsold chicken. Butter Chicken is one of my top five favorite Indian recipes. Butter chicken originated from using leftover dry tandoori chicken and giving it moisture with a creamy spiced tomato sauce — plus some butter, and we have butter chicken. A delicious chicken dish that can be made as hot or as mild as you wish - a perfect meal for curry lovers who want to keep it simple.
