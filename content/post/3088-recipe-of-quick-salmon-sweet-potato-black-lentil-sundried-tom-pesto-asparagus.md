While nothing like basil, sun-dried tomatoes are actually a great stand-in when it comes to pesto. The pesto is sweet and salty, but not overly so, with a tinge of bitterness from the walnuts. It&#39;s a phenomenal equalizer and balancer, bringing to dishes that &#34;little something&#34; that might be missing. A grilled salmon and asparagus salad that&#39;s topped with blistered tomatoes and feta cheese. Its elegant but simple - the best!
