recipeingredient:
- " Dough"
- "25 g Demerara Sugar"
- "5 g Sea Salt"
- "120 g Unsweetened Almond Milk Preferably Organic"
- "60 g Water"
- "1 TSP Active Instant Dry Yeast"
- "400 g Unbleached All Purpose Flour"
- "1 Avocado Mashed"
- " Wash"
- " Olive Oil For Greasing"
- "13 g Maple Syrup Preferably Grade A"
- " Rolled Oats For Garnishing"
- "15 g Water"
- " Black Sesame Seeds For Garnishing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the dough.   In a large bowl, add flour and yeast.   Mix until well combined.   In another bowl, add sugar, salt, almond milk and water.   Whisk until the sugar has dissolved. Whisk, whisk, whisk."
- "In another bowl, add in mashed avocado.   *You can mash the avocado using a fork. Make sure the avocado is properly mashed and there’s no large chunk.*   Gradually pour the milk mixture into the mashed avocado in 1/3 portions while still whisking.   Continue whisking and adding until everything is incorporated. It is normal if there are small chunks or lumps."
- "Add 2 TBSP of the flour mixture at a time, into the batter.   Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.  Add the avocado mixture in 1/2 portions while still mixing.  Repeat the process until everything is incorporated and comes together into a dough."
- "Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour are kneaded into the dough, about 8 to 10 minutes.   The dough should be tacky, but not sticky, smooth and it should pass the &#34;window-pane&#34; test.   If the dough is too dry, add in water, 1 TBSP at a time. If the dough is too sticky, add in flour, 1 TBSP at a time."
- "Generously grease the bowl with olive oil.   Transfer the dough back to the greased bowl.   Cover with cling film and let rise for 2 hrs or until doubled in size.   Weigh and divide the dough into 8 equal dough.  Shape and roll each dough tightly into balls.  Line parchment paper on a baking tray and place in the muffin rings."
- "Do make sure that the muffin rings are greased generously with olive oil.*  You may require 2 trays.  Transfer the dough balls into the center of each muffin rings.  Cover with a damp lint free kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour."
- "Prepare the wash.   In a bowl add maple syrup and water.   Mix until well combined.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius or 350 fahrenheit.   Brush each dough ball with the sugar mixture.  Garnish with oats and sesame seeds.   *If the dough balls don&#39;t seem to be touching the muffin rings fully, it is perfectly fine and normal.*"
- "Wack into the oven and bake for about 20 mins or until the top is dark ample brown in color.   Rotate the baking tray at half way mark.   *When you insert a skewer into the buns, the skewer should come out clean.*   Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely on a cooling rack before slicing and serving."
