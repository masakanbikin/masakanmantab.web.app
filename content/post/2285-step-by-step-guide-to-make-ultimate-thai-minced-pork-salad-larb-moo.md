- "On a medium heat, add the oil to the wok and wait for it to heat up. Add the ground mince pork and fry for a few minutes until it changes colour. Stir occasionally to prevent it from burning and sticking. Once the meat is cooked, turn off the heat and set aside to cool down."
- "Thinly slice the chillis, place in a pestle &amp; mortar, gently crush (this ensures that the spiciness of the chilli infuses with the rest of the ingredients). Add the fish sauce, lemon or lime juice, palm sugar and water to the mortar. Mix well together and taste (adjust to taste, if too sweet add more fish sauce or if too salty, add more palm sugar). Sauce should have balance of sweet, sour and hot. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Wash the mortar as it will be used later again for the rice."
- "In a small pan, place the uncooked rice and gently toast it on very low heat for a few minutes. Stir occasionally until lightly golden brown. Turn off the heat as soon as the colour changes to avoid it tasting burnt. Place in mortar to let it cool down."
- "Place washed baby gem lettuce in a colander and drain off all of the excess water. On a large plate or bowl, separate each of the baby gem lettuce leaves. Roughly crush the cooled down rice in the mortar and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, add the cooled down mince pork to the chopped vegetables and the sauce and mix well to coat all of the ingredients. At this stage, give it a sample taste to make sure the flavours are still balanced. Depending on if it is too sour or sweet, amend as in step 3."
- "Add the toasted rice (if not using rice, add the sesame seeds). Finally, chop the mint leaves roughly and add to the mixing bowl. Give it a final good mix. Transfer the larb salad to large serving bowl and place the baby gem lettuce behind the salad or in a separate bowl."
- "Serve with lime or lemon wedges. Larb salad is traditionally eaten with a glutinous sticky rice on the side, or alternatively a bowl of steamed rice."
