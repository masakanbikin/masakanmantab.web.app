- "Preheat oven to 350°F – 180°C Place the bell peppers directly onto a high flame on your stove or burner.  Turn it ensuring it becomes charcoal black all over. Don’t be scared to make it really black.  Remove from heat, place in a bowl or container and cover until cool enough to handle.  Using your hands, simply rub away the burnt skin, it should peel off easily.  Remove the core, seeds and scrape away any remaining seeds.  Cut into rough pieces ready for blending."

- "Breakdown your chicken into pieces keeping the bones including the breastbone.  Score the skin several times using a sharp knife."
- "Pour the chili mixture into your baking pan and smother the chicken pieces in the chili mixture using your hands, spread the mixture so it coats all the chicken pieces evenly.  Place roasting pan and roast for 50 minutes at 350°F – 180°C or until the chicken is nicely cooked.  If you see a little burnt black on some pieces, that’s perfect, it’s supposed to have some black on it for that BBQ flavour."
