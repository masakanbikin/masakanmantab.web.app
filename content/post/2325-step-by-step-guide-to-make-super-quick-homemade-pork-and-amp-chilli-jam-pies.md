recipeingredient:
- " For the hot crust pastry"
- "400 g plain flour"
- "80 g strong plain flour"
- "80 g unsalted butter"
- "100 g melted lard or vegetable shortening"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "200 ml boiling water"
- "1 beaten egg to glaze"
- " For the filling"
- "600 g pork loin finely chopped"
- "130 g pancetta"
- "1 large onion finely chopped"
- "1 teaspoon dried parsley"
- "1 teaspoon dried sage"
- " Black pepper  fine sea salt to season"
- "3 tablespoons chilli jam"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, prepare the filling. Finely chop your pork loin and place in a bowl with the pancetta. Do the same with the onion; add the dried parsley, sage, salt and pepper. Mix it all around so that the pork &amp; pancetta are well seasoned. Finally add the chilli jam and stir the lot together. Cover the bowl and pop into the fridge whilst you prepare your pastry."
- "At this point it’s a good idea to pop the oven on so preheat your oven to 190c/375f/gas mark 5. Lightly grease a 12 holed muffin tin."
- "To make the pastry, add both flours to a large bowl and rub in the butter. Add the salt to the boiling water so that it dissolves. Add the melted lard into the boiling water/salt and then pour this into the flour mixture. Initially, because it will be HOT, mix this with a spoon so that the pastry starts to form. Once cool enough take the dough out of the bowl and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Work the dough into a ball."
- "Roll it out to a thickness of around 4mm and then cut into circles of around 10cms, enough to fit each “well” of the muffin tin. Press these into the muffin tins and then cut out another 12 circles of around 8cms for the lids of the pies."
- "Add a good heaped teaspoon (or more) to each pastry case so that it nearly fills each one and then place the lid of each pie on top. Carefully seal the lid to the edge of each case and crimp it well so that it minimises the risk of any juices leaking whilst they bake. Poke a hole in the top of each pie to allow steam to escape and brush the top of each one with some beaten egg – this will give each pie a lovely golden finish."
- "Pop them into the oven to bake for 50 minutes. Once they’ve finished get them out and carefully remove each one and transfer to a wire baking tray to cool. Once cooled you can either eat them as is or pop them into the fridge where they will be good for up to 3-4 days."
