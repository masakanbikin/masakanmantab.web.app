recipeingredient:
- "600 g pork shoulder steaks"
- "2 tsp salt"
- "3 tbsp brandy"
- "1 green pepper"
- "3 spring onions"
- "100 g bamboo shoots"
- "2 free range eggs"
- "2 tablespoons cornflour"
- "6 tablespoons sieved plain white flour"
- "200 ml pure vegetable oil"

- "3 tbsp white vinegar"
- "3 tbsp caster sugar"
- "1 teaspoon salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Discard the large pieces of fat from the pork steaks. Cut the remaining meat into bitesize chunks."
- "Place the brandy and the salt into a container. Add the pork pieces and stir or shake well. Leave to stand for 15 minutes. This will help to flavour and tenderise the pork."
- "While you&#39;re waiting for the pork to marinade you should begin making the sauce. Measure out all the sauce ingredients in a large jug and mix really well. You can taste test it at this point. The sugar and vinegar should balance each other out. #previewflavour"
- "Cut the green pepper into similar sized chunks as the pork. You can use any colour pepper. Green is just a nice contrasting colour for this dish."
- "Roughly chop the spring onions into 1 cm chunks."
- "Measure out your bamboo shoots. I&#39;ve made this dish numerous times without the shoots so if they&#39;re hard to get in your area don&#39;t worry. It will still be amazing without them. Mine came from a local supermarket (Tesco UK)."
- "Break the two free range eggs into your marinated pork and add the cornflour. Mix well."
- "Measure out your sieved plain white flour into a shallow bowl."
- "Now take each piece of eggy pork and coat in plain white flour. Then set aside onto a plate. If you run out of plain white flour just sieve out some more."
- "I like to split my flour coated pork into batches ready for frying. Discard the left over egg."
- "Add the vegetable oil to a wok. Heat over a medium flame."
- "Now start shallow frying your pork for 3 minutes per batch. It should turn golden brown, fry all sides evenly. A metal perforated spoon is extremely helpful during this step."
- "Line a shallow bowl with paper towels. After each batch of pork has finished cooking transfer to this bowl. The paper will help soak up some of the excess fat and keep things nice and crispy."
- "Discard the oil used during the shallow frying. Be very careful with this oil it will be extremely hot. Clean the wok and add some fresh vegetable oil."
- "Re-fry the meat with the bamboo shoots for 2 minutes."
- "Remove the paper from your shallow bowl and transfer the fried meat and bamboo shoots back into it."
- "In your now empty wok add a tiny bit more vegetable oil and fry the green peppers for 2 minutes."
- "Add the spring onions to the peppers and continue to fry for 1 minute."
- "Give the sauce a thorough stir and add into the wok. Cook and stir until it thickens. Keep the sauce moving otherwise the cornflour will go lumpy."
- "Add the fried pork and bamboo shoots back into the wok combine everything well."
- "Serve hot with rice. I recommend egg / special fried rice as a good accompaniment. Enjoy!"
