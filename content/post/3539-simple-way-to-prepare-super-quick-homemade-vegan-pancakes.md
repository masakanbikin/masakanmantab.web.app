Baking powder is a leavening agent that creates bubbles in the batter, making for an airy pancake. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. The baking powder causes the pancake batter to rise and produces perfectly fluffy and tender vegan pancakes. The amount of baking powder in the recipe is correct. It looks like a lot, but since this recipe is made without eggs, you do need that large amount of baking powder to make these vegan pancakes rise.
