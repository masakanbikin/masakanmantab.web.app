recipeingredient:
- "1 Cup Jasmine Rice"
- "1 Portion Iceberg Lettuce"
- "1 Portion Rocket"
- "1 Carrot"
- "2 Baby Corns"
- "1/2 Cob Sweetcorn"
- "1 serving of Tofu"
- "2 Spring Onions"
- "1 Tbsp Sesame Oil"
- "3 Tsp Sriracha"
- "1 Tbsp Mayonnaise"
- "2 Tsp Soy Sauce"
- "2 Tbsp Plain Flour"
- "2 Tbsp Oil"
- " Optional Baked Chickpeas or other leftover dish"
- "To Taste Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the rice until it is dry, but a little sticky. Add half of the sesame oil to the rice, along with some salt to taste. Set aside to cool."
- "Meanwhile, peel the carrot and using the peeler, cut it into ribbons. Finely chop the lettuce and spring onion. Boil the corn in a pot of water, the baby corn will only need about 30 seconds (this is my preference, I don&#39;t like un-cooked baby corn) and the corn on the cob will need about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool."
- "Press the water out of the tofu and chop into medium chunks. Mix the flour with a little salt and toss the tofu in the flour, so it is evenly coated. In a non-stick pan heat up the oil and half of the remaining sesame oil (make sure to leave some). When it is hot place the tofu in the pan (it should sizzle when added) gently fry on each side, until golden-brown."
- "Now let&#39;s make the sauce! Combine the mayonnaise, Sriracha, remaining sesame oil and soy-sauce and mix well, until fully combined. The corn should be cool by now. Chop the baby-corn into small pieces, so it looks like flowers. Strip the main corn on the cob by placing it end-up on the chopping board and chopping downwards, towards the board."
- "Time to assemble! First, add the rice, so it takes up a 3rd of your bowl (it should be nice and sticky, so easy to shape). Then add the optional chickpeas (or other left-overs). Add the lettuce and rocket, this should take up about a quarter. On top of this add the sweetcorn, carrot, tofu and spring onion. Drizzle with the Srirachannaise and enjoy!"
