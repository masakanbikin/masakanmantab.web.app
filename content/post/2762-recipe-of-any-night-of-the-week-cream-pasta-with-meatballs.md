- "Add the cream and some milk. Keep the heat at a simmer and not a boil. Gradually whisk in the cream cheese. Add bay leaves and other herbs. Constantly stirring."
- "Add another pat of butter, some parmesan and pasta water for salt and texture, milk to neutralise the saltiness or increase the volume of the cream sauce. Salt to taste. This is where you play by ear in how creamy or salty you want your sauce to be."
- "Serve pasta with a ladle full of cream sauce coating the linguine, 2-3 meatballs a plate, add a sprinkle of parsley if you&#39;re feeling fancy. Store leftovers in fridge and heat up with a little milk each time."
