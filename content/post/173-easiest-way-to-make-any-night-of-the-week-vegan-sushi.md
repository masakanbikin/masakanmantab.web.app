recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the rice, with the vinegar, sugar and salt until sticky. Drain and leave to cool."
- "Chop the veggies into batons and strips (including the spring onion)."
- "On your rolling mat place a sheet of Nori shiny side down. Place about 2-3 tablespoons of rice in the centre of the sheet and press out evenly into a 1cm thick rectangle.

- "Repeat with the rest of the ingredients. Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi into 1 1/2 inch pieces. You can also wrap the rolls in clingfilm and cut them through that (it’s a bit easier)."
