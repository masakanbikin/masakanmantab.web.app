Toast the bread under a broiler (on both sides) or in the toaster. While the toast is still warm, immediately rub it (aggressively!) with the cut side of the garlic clove, then spread toast generously with butter. Top butter with tomato slices and lightly salt them.

If you&#39;re in the love &#39;em camp, here&#39;s an easy snack (or even a light lunch!) that celebrates canned sardines and pairs them with tangy pickled onions, zesty Dijon mustard, and nutty crispbreads. I find canned sardines intensely fishy, so other strong flavors are needed to balance everything out. Assemble the toasts: drain the sardine fillets and lightly brush the toasts with the remaining vinaigrette. Pile three or four slices of avocado onto each toast, top with a portion of the sardines, and scatter scallions and a few chives on top.

The salty flavor and rich texture of sardines is the perfect complement to crispy, crunchy bread. Just toast up a slice from your favorite loaf, butter it, and spread a few sardines over top. Alternatively, spread mayonnaise on toast, top it with sardines, and sprinkle the whole thing with a little bit of fennel. Topped on toast or Wasa crackers, sardines make a simple, light meal. Add a spread of mustard, a squeeze of lemon, or some sliced tomatoes and red onion for more flavor.
