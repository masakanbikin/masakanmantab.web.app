- "4 chicken breasts thickly sliced across the grain of the meat"

- "1/2 tsp Chilli flakes or equivalent"
- "2 tbsp Garlic oil or 2 Garlic cloves crushed and 2 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1 tsp Sumac optional"
- "1 tsp Harissa optional"
- "1 tbsp Honey warmed until runny"
- "1 tbsp Lemon juice"
- "1 tin chopped tomatoes"
- "1/2 pt hot stock"
- "Half a pack of green Beans cut into pieces"
- " Vegetable oil"
- "4 handfuls couscous"
- " Rind and juice of 1 lemon"
- "1 handful chopped dates optional Raisins or Sultanas also work well"
- "1 tsp Sumac optional"
- "1/2 tsp Chilli flakes or similar equivalent"
- "1 tsp Dried parsley"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- " Salt Pepper"
- " Fresh Parsley chopped"
- " Toasted Almond flakes optional we dont use these due to a nut allergy in the family"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the cumin, cinnamon, sumac, harissa, garlic oil or garlic and oil, lemon juice, honey and chilli flakes together in a bowl. Place chicken into the spice mix and coat each piece thoroughly. Put aside to marinate."
- "Put the lemon rind, juice, olive oil, cumin, sumac, dates or dried fruit, chilli flakes and dried parsley into a pudding bowl. Add couscous and mix together. Pour boiling water over the couscous until it is about half a centimetre above the level of the couscous. Stir with a fork and set aside in a warm place to swell."
- "Heat a large frying pan and add some vegetable oil to lightly coat the surface. Add the pieces of marinated chicken and cook without moving the pieces for a few minutes until well browned, almost charred. Turn over and repeat the process. Cook in batches to avoid overcrowding which will cause the chicken to boil and become tough and pallid. It’s also very important NOT to move meat around when cooking otherwise it won’t brown properly."
- "Once the chicken is all cooked, return it all to the pan and add the hot stock and stir to de-glaze the pan, followed by the tomatoes. Stir and bring to a simmer."
- "Lightly boil the beans in salted water in a separate pan until all dente."
- "Add the beans to the chicken and stir. Cook for 20 minutes on a low / medium heat to reduce the sauce. Check flavour and season."
- "Zap the couscous in the microwave for 1 minute if it’s got too cool."
- "Serve the chicken and couscous along with a sprinkling of chopped Parsley. A few toasted Almond flakes makes a good addition if you have them. We always have some extra green veg with ours for added nutrients."
