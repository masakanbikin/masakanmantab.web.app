recipeingredient:
- " Steaming tofu"
- "1 block tofu silkensoft or medium tofu"
- "4-6 cups water steaming tofu"
- " Sweet soy dressing sauce"
- "3 teaspoons sugar caster or granulated"
- "2 tablespoons light soya sauce add more or less depending on preference"
- "4 tablespoons water"
- "1 teaspoon sesame oil pure or blended depending on preference optional"
- " Garnish"
- "1 stalk spring onion finely chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use a large pot with a steamer basket or use a wok with a bamboo steamer. Add water and cover with lid on high heat. Bring water to a boil."
- "In the meantime, open the block of tofu, place in a bowl. Transfer the tofu on a chopping board with a paper towel on top. This drains the liquid and soaks up the excess moisture."
- "Pat the tofu with paper towel to remove excess moisture on top. Gently remove the paper towel from the board. Slice tofu across the middle horizontally."
- "Cut into 3 vertically, then horizontally down slicing tofu into cubes. Transfer to a bowl and place in steamer basket."
- "Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to medium. Place the steamer in the pot or or the bamboo steamer on top of the wok. Let the tofu steam for about 20 minutes."
- "While tofu steams, make the sweet soya dressing sauce. In a small saucepan, add the sugar, soya sauce and water. On medium heat bring mixture to a boil and keep stirring often to dissolve the sugar. Once sugar has dissolved and mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low. Add the sesame oil (if adding) now. Stir constantly and heat for another minute. Turn off the heat and set aside."
- "Once tofu has steamed, be careful when removing the steamer basket from pot as it will be hot. Place steamer basket on a large plate. Using a slotted spoon gently transfer the steamed tofu (without the excess water created from steaming) into a serving bowl. Pour all over the sweet soy dressing sauce. This will seep into the tofu making it flavoursome."
- "Lastly, garnish the tofu with spring onions. This adds a fresh taste and gives another texture to the tofu. Eat immediately while hot and serve with a bowl of rice and side accompaniments like vegetables or Thai omelette."
