In this carrot noodle stir fry, I&#39;ve used my super awesome Paderno Spiralizer to make long, twisty carrot noodles that mimic (at least in look) spaghetti While the tofu is frying, use your spiralizer to make noodles from the carrots. You could also use a julienne peeler or cut the carrots into long, thin. Reduce heat to low; add noodles, tossing gently to coat. Add tofu, green onions and sesame oil; cook. Stir the tofu to flip the sides and let set for another minute.
