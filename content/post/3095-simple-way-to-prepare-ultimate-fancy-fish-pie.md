- "500 ml reserved poaching milk PLUS an extra 100ml"
- "1 tbsp Lemon Juice"
- "2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley"
- " Freshly grated nutmeg"
- " salt and black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, poach the fish: put the fish into a frying pan and pour over the 500ml milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove, then add to the milk with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil - this will be just a few bubbles appearing - and reduce the heat to simmer for 8 minutes."
- "Flake the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool, as you will use this later for the sauce. Flake the fish into large pieces into a large shallow oven-proof baking dish. Place the raw prawns and scallops evenly over the fish. Scatter over the chopped parsley."
- "Next, get the potatoes going for the mash by placing them into a large saucepan of cold, salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for around 15 - 20 minutes, or until tender."
- "Meanwhile, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, stir in the flour using a hand whisk and cook for around 10 minutes, stirring continuously until the flour is ‘cooked out’. The consistency will change to a thinner ‘sauce’ and the colour should go slightly caramel. This is when you know it is ready to add the milk."
- "Take off the heat and gradually add the milk, a big splash at a time, whisking well each time to create a smooth sauce. As the milk will have been warm when adding, the sauce should thicken fairly quickly. Return to the heat and continue cooking if it needs to thicken a little more. Finish the sauce by adding the nutmeg, parsley, lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Pour this evenly over the fish. Preheat the oven to 190C fan."
- "Drain the potatoes well, giving them a bash, tip them back into the pan and mash well. Add the butter and mix well until melted using a fork now in a whisky motion to begin fluffing the mash. Add the milk, a splash at a time until you have a creamy, smooth consistency. You may not need to use all of the milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste and add the nutmeg to taste."
- "Top the pie now with the mash, starting at the edges and working your way in. Smooth it down and then mark with a fork. Top with the grated mature cheddar."
- "Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and bubbling all the way through. If your pie was assembled cold, it may take slightly longer in the oven. Serve with buttered peas tossed in parsley."

The tasty fish mix is layered with a luxurious fennel and lemon mash. To make it even better we then add a layer of cheese, flaked almonds and pine nuts. This is the one to make if you want guests to reach for an additional portion. This is James&#39; version of a classic British dish - fish pie. He&#39;s gone a bit fancy on this occasion though, adding some langoustines and a rich, buttery mash..
