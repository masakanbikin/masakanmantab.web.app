- "225 g plain flour"
- "100 g caster sugar"
- "175 g butter"
- " Some assorted coloured boiled sweets"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to approx.. 160C/fan 140C/gas 3. Get your oven trays ready, add grease proof paper."
- "Add butter and sugar into a bowl and mix until smooth. Then add flour and bring the dough together using your hands, so it is ready to roll out."
- "Lightly flour the work surface to avoid it sticking and roll out the dough so it’s around 5mm thick. Then use a large cutter (of any shape you desire) cut out the outside shape of the biscuit"
- "Then using a small cutter or knife, cut out a small section from the middle leaving a whole (where we will add the sweets later). Using a tooth pick make a small whole on top of each biscuit (so it can be hung on the tree later). Then arrange the shaped biscuits on the baking tray."
- "Separate the sweets into different colours and crush either using a rolling pin or pestle and morter. The crushed sweets can then be added in to the middle of each biscuit. You can mix and match the colours if you wish."
- "Put in oven and bake for 15-20minutes or until golden brown (the sweets would have melted by now)."
- "Take out and let them cool for about 5 minutes, before serving or add some string to the biscuits and they are ready to be hung on your Christmas tree :)"
- "Enjoy some tasty biscuits perfect for all the family"
