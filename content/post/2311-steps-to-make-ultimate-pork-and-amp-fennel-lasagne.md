recipeinstructions:
- "Heat some olive oil in a pan on a medium heat and add the pork mice. Cook for 10 mins until no longer pink. Use a utensil to break the pork into small bits as it cooks. Add the onion and cook for a further 5-10 mins until the onion has softened."
- "Add the crushed garlic and season with salt and pepper. Stir for 2 mins. Add the fennel seeds and stir. Add the tomato puree and stir. Heat for a further couple of mins."

- "One the mixture has cooked slowly, start to layer in an oven proof dish. Start with a third of the mixture. Then the lasagne sheets. Repeat two more times. (If you are using GF lasagne sheets add a bit of the remaining Passata to the pasta sheets - adding a layer of liquid will prevent them from being chewy)."
- "Add the mascarpone to another pan with the milk and a generous crack of pepper. Stir on a low heat until all the mascarpone has melted. This only takes a few minutes."
- "Add the sauce to the lasagne."
- "Top with cheese (I used a mixture as that’s what I had in the fridge - but use whatever cheese and how much you like). Add a crack of pepper. Cook in the oven at 200c for approx 30 mins or until the cheese has started to colour."
- "Remove, add the garnish (optional) and serve."
