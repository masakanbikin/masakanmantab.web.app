The Italian pasta dish is known for its many, tasty layers. In the vegan version, bolognese ragout, b√©chamel sauce, parmesan and lasagne sheets are also layered one after the other, but made from vegan ingredients: Lasagna sheets are often made from an egg dough. Top it off with flavorful Arugula Almond Pesto! This delicious Eggplant Lasagna is so warm and comforting -it is one of those dishes you actually get kind of excited about the leftovers.
