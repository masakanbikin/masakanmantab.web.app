recipeinstructions:
- "In a clean, dry glass jar, add the chopped dry fruits and the rum and mix well together with a wooden spoon. Seal the jar and keep in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Every 2-3 days, give the fruit a mix and add about ¼ cup more rum if it looks too dry. You can soak the dry fruits for 1 – 4 weeks before you bake the cake."
- "Reheat the oven to 150 degrees for 10 minutes. In a broad pan, add the raisins and chopped prunes. Add butter, mixed spice powder, dark brown sugar, honey, orange zest from 2 oranges and orange juice from 1 and 1/2 orange add remaining half at-last if needed."
- "Add cocoa powder, grape juice and bring the mixture to boil in low flame. It takes about 5-8 minutes to start the mixture to bubble.

In a separate bowl add the all purpose flour, ground almonds, baking powder, baking soda and salt together and mix with a whisk to combine well. After around 30 minutes, once the mixture has cooled a little, add the beaten eggs. Now add this flour almond mix into the fruit mixture and mix with a spatula until the ingredients have combined."
- "If you feel the batter is thick drizzle little orange juice now to loosen the batter. Carefully pour the fruit cake mixture into the lined 20 cm with minimum of 7-8 cm height cake tin. Cover the cake tin with another wax paper on top to prevent the sides from burning. Transfer the cake tin to the oven and bake for around 1 and 3/4 to 2 hours, or until the top of the cake is firm. If you insert a sharp knife into the middle of the cake the knife should come out clean."
