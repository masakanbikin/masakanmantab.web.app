recipeingredient:
- "150 grams flour"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1 large free range egg"
- "200 ml milk"
- "2 tsp Pumpkin Spice Mix"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl add the flour, baking powder and sugar. Gradually add your beaten egg into the dry ingredients then slowly whisk in the milk to make a batter. If you think you need to add more milk do so, but it should be a nice thick smooth consistency. Now I add the aromatic Pumpkin Spice Mix and fold into the batter, now I usually put my batter into the fridge for half hour at this stage but you don’t need to if you don’t want to."
- "Heat up your waffle pan on the hob until nice and hot, carefully spray some light vegetable oil into your pan and pour the mixture in. Cook on one side until you can flip it over and then repeat until cooked thoroughly. Serve straight away with your favourite accompaniment. In my case just simple icing sugar and a nice cup of hot pumpkin spice latte."
