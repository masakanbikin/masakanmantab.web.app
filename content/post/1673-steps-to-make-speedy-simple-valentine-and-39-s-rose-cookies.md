recipeingredient:
- "120 grams White flour"
- "10 to 15 grams Cocoa unsweetened"
- "1 tbsp Skim milk if you have"
- "100 grams Butter"
- "3 tbsp Milk"
- "50 grams Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let the butter soften at room temperature. Add the sugar and mix well so it turns into a creamy texture. Mix until the sugar becomes smooth."
- "Once the butter is softened add the milk a little bit at a time and mix. You should be aiming for the consistency of mayonnaise. If it&#39;s too stiff immerse in a hot water bath."
- "Sift the ＊ ingredients, and then sift into the bowl."
- "Use a rubber spatula and mix in a cutting motion. It&#39;ll be crumbly at first but eventually it&#39;ll become a stiff cream."
- "Place in a pastry bag with a 5 mm tip. If you put the bag in a large cup it&#39;ll be easier to add the dough."
- "Make the cookie shape by squeezing from the middle and making a circular motion. For the outside try to layer it, like a flower petal."
- "Cook in your preheated oven at 170°C (338 Fahrenheit) for 15 to 20 minutes."
- "Once finished cool and transfer to your serving plate."
- "A close-up of the rose. So lovely. Don&#39;t press it, don&#39;t get impatient, and let the dough fall into place."
- "Heart shapes are also easy. This one&#39;s a bit bold! I tried to make it small, but that was quite the effort."
- "When squeezing out do it in a massaging motion. It&#39;ll be a bit stiff at first, but it&#39;ll soften from the warmth of your hand."
