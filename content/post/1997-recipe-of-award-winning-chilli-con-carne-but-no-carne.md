Chili con Carne (Nahuatl chilli, spanisch con carne „mit Fleisch&#34;) ist die Bezeichnung eines scharfen Gerichts aus Fleisch und Chilischoten. Weder der Ursprung des Namens Chili con Carne noch der eines Originalrezepts ist eindeutig geklärt, wahrscheinlich liegt er im Süden Nordamerikas. When you remove the chillies before serving, toss them into a mini chopper with a splash more oil and blitz to make a chilli oil paste. The surprise ingredient in this triple-tested chilli con carne is coffee, which helps to tenderise the meat and add greater depth of flavour. Cook chilli but don&#39;t stir in the coriander.
