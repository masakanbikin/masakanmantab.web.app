recipeinstructions:
- "Take a glass jar and soak all chopped dried fruits in alcohol or fruit juice. I have used apple juice here, you can use orange juice, cranberry juice or grape juice. If using alcohol, preferred is rum or you can also use brandy, whisky or vodka.Ensure dried fruits are chopped well (approx. ½ cm in size). This is important for even cake. Do take a good shake after you pour juice or alcohol in the dried fruits &amp; let them soak for at least 1 week or 2 day."
- "First of all prepare loaf tin. Grease tin with butter and line with parchment paper. Line outer side of the tin with aluminum foil strap to restrict too much heat.  Ground dried spices (nutmeg/cinnamon/black pepper &amp; cloves) into the fine powder. Now take a big bowl and start whisking softened butter using hand whisk till smooth and fluffy (avoid electric beater). Mix brown sugar and whisk again till everything is mixed well."
- "Start adding eggs one at a time and whisk. After adding all eggs, incorporate orange pulp, almond powder and powdered spices using spatula. Do not use whisk here. Now it’s time to sieve all-purpose flour in the cake batter and fold using spatula."
- "After folding flour, now its time to add soaked dried fruits, chopped pistachios and cashew nuts in the batter. Do strain soaked fruits once but do not throw away this juice as we will use it to feed our cake later."
- "Batter is ready to go in the lined loaf tin. With the help of serving spoon, fill the load tin with batter, push to the corner and level it properly. Preheat your oven on 150 degree Celsius and bake the cake for approx. 3 &amp; ½ hours on 150 degree Celsius. In my oven it took me 4 hours 15 minutes to bake my cake to the perfection. Do ensure to check your cake after 3 hours every 15 min by inserting skewer or knife to check if it is done or not."
- "Once cake is completely cool, demold carefully, poke hole using a skewer and feed your cake using remaining juice of the soaked dried fruits. And keep on feeding the cake one or twice a day using alcohol or fruits juice. This helps cake remain moist and gives beautiful deep flavor to the cake. Cover your cake with aluminum foil and parchment paper and keep it in the room temperature. Do not keep this cake in the refrigerator. Shelf life of this cake is more than a month.Enjoy this lovely cake :)"
