- "Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest about 20 minutes."
- "To make the BBQ cauliflower: add the cauliflower florets to a parchment lined baking tray."
- "To a small bowl, add the BBQ sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder, and stir to combine. Pour half of the sauce over the florets, and toss to coat. Reserve the other half of the BBQ sauce for later."

- "To make the garlic yogurt sauce: combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a bowl, and stir to combine."
- "When the pizzas are ready, drizzle some of the garlic yogurt sauce on top, and sprinkle over the sliced scallion."
