recipeingredient:
- "2 Meiji Milk Chocolate Bar"
- "100 grams Biscuit cookies"
recipeinstructions:
- "This is all that&#39;s needed!"
- "Put the biscuit cookies in a thick plastic bag (or you can layer two normal plastic bags) and break with a rolling pin until they are finely crushed."
- "Break the chocolate bars into a heat resistant bowl and microwave for 1.5 to 3 minutes. The time varies based on your microwave and your bowl so keep an eye on it and adjust as needed."
- "Even if the chocolate isn&#39;t completely melted when you first take it out of the microwave, it should melt if you mix with a spoon."
- "Now add your crushed biscuit cookies and mix into the chocolate. Mix really well until you can&#39;t see the biscuits anymore. This is really important."
- "Use a small spoon to pack the chocolate into the heart shaped molds. Press the chocolate in firmly to make sure there are no air pockets. It&#39;s best to fill the molds so that the chocolate is overflowing just a little bit."
- "When the chocolate has started to cool and the outer layer is firming up, place a sheet of parchment paper on top and firmly push the chocolate into the mold. Push it hard, like you&#39;re trying to break the biscuits. If there are air pockets between the chocolate and biscuit bits, then the chocolates won&#39;t harden nicely."
- "Leave the parchment paper on and let cool and harden, and you&#39;re done! To take out of the mold, remove the parchment paper and try flipping the mold upside down and hitting the back. You can also try lightly rapping it on a flat surface and they should loosen and pop out. Make sure not to break the chocolates when trying to get them out."
- "This is how they look wrapped in aluminum foil."
- "More cute wrapping."
- "Tips for making them look nice and smooth, at Step 5, make sure to mix the biscuit bits really well until you don&#39;t see them anymore."
- "At Step 7, make sure to firmly and strongly push the chocolate into the molds so there are no air pockets."
