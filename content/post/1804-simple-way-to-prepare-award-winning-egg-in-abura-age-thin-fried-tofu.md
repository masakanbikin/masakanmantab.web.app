- " Sauce"
- "2 tablespoons Soy sauce"
- "1 cup Dashi Stock 1 cup Water and 12 teaspoon Dashi Powder"
- "2 tablespoon Mirin"
- "2 tablespoons Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wrap Abura-age with paper towel and heat in microwave for 30 seconds. Then press it to remove excess oil if required.  *Note: This process is optional, but the heat softens Abura-age and next process will be easier. If you don’t have the microwave, soak in hot water is alternative option. Dry with paper towel."
- "Cut each Abura-age in half, carefully open and make bags. Crack an Egg, place it in a bag and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining Abura-age and Eggs."
- "Place all the ingredients of the sauce in a large saucepan or pot, and bring to the boil over medium heat."
- "Once the sauce starts boiling, gently place the Abura-age bags in the sauce, cook for 5 minutes. Turn them over, and cook for further 5 minutes. Then remove from the sauce. If you leave them in the hot saucepan, the eggs will be cooked more."
- "Simmer the remaining sauce until slightly thickens, then pour over the cooked Abura-age bags."
- "*Note: Cooking time depends on your preference. If you want the Eggs cooked softer or harder, alter the cooking time."
