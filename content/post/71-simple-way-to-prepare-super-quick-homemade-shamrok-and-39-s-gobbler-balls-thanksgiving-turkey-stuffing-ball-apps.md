- "1 1214 oz Can Jellied Cranberry Sauce"
- "1/2 cup 1 Stick Butter"
- "1/4 cup Sugar"

- "1 CanJar Turkey Gravy heated"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 Degrees(F)."
- "Prepare 2 boxes of Stove Top Stuffing for Turkey.  Set Aside."
- "Mix all Meatball Ingredients together gently with hands.  Roll into small meatballs.  Use about 1 Tbsp. of meat mixture for each one.  Place meatballs onto parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake for about 15-20 minutes until done."
- "Put approximately 2 tsp. of Stuffing into the palm of your hand and flatten it out.   Place a meatball into the center of the stuffing and wrap the stuffing around the meatball.    Once there’s stuffing around the meatball, roll it as when you made the meatballs.    This will allow a thin coating of the stuffing to cover the entire surface of the meatball.  You don’t want the stuffing too thick around the outside."
- "As you roll out each ball, place them in a pan/bowl with the other 1 cup of Bread Crumbs.    Roll each ball to lightly coat in bread crumbs.                     Repeat with all of the meatballs."
- "Helpful Hint:  It helps to refrigerate the balls for at least an hour before frying, but it’s not completely necessary."
- "Fry the balls lightly in ¼ Cup Vegetable Oil.  Remove each as done and drain on towel lined plate."
- "Cranberry Glaze Instructions:  Place all ingredients in medium saucepan and bring to a simmer for about 10 minutes.    Stir until smooth.  Spoon on top of meatballs for serving."
- "Placing each ball into a small paper cupcake liner adds to the presentation and ease of serving."
