Japanese Vegetable Soup (Kenchinjiru) was originally a Buddhist dish that is vegetarian. Root vegetables and tofu are sautéed and cooked in flavoured dashi broth. But &#39;kenchin&#39; doesn&#39;t mean vegetable and even for Japanese, &#39;kenchin&#39; is a strange name and the sound is so unlike Japanese. This soup is called &#39;Kenchin-jiru&#39; in Japan.
