The crown jewel was a few pickle slices (mine were spicy/sweet) and a heavy handed shmear of honey dijonnaise. These sandwiches combine the shattering panko crispiness of katsu-style cutlets and the fiery heat found in Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up It&#39;s a very fool-proof recipe for someone like me who is new to frying. These baked spicy chicken sandwiches have three layers of heat and are topped with a creamy-sweet quick homemade coleslaw.
