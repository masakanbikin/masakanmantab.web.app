Just as good as our favorite Indian restaurant makes, and not as heavy. This vegan korma is made with fresh vegetables and chickpeas, simmered in an Indian-inspired coconut curry sauce and topped with roasted cashews and fresh cilantro. Korma is one of my FAVORITE things to get when I go out for Indian food. It&#39;s a little spicy, saucy, and so delicious. This restaurant-standard Vegan Korma is anything but bland and boring.
