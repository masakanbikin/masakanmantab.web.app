recipeingredient:
- "2 large avocados ripe but slightly firm"
- "1 each cheese"
- "1 spices of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut avocado in half by cutting down to pit, rotate fruit around knife until cut ends meet"
- "Grab each half and twist to separate halves, 1 should contain the pit"
- "Carefully whack pit in center with shape blade of knife, so the blade is embedded about 1/4 inch. Twist knife (like you did the other half before) until the pit pops out. To remove pit from knife, from the dull side of the blade (back) pinch pit so it pops off knife."
- "Use a fork to poke a bunch of holes into the flesh of the avocado. Drizzle, spray or brush a little oil on the halfs. I usually use light olive oil, but any should work."
- "Put the halfs on a baking sheet. You are better off if they are level and don&#39;t rock. If you don&#39;t have a rack like here, you can make a little donut from foil to hold them in place."
- "Sprinkle spice mix of your choice on the avocado. Here I used a &#34;Mexican blend&#34; but I have used others in the past. A slightly stronger flavor seems to be better do it didn&#39;t get lost."
- "Cover the halfs with shredded cheese. Cheddar is shown here, but Swiss, Italian blend, all seem to work that melt. This picture shows 2 with spice before cheese, and 2 with cheese before cooing."
- "Broil so the top of the avocado is about 3-4 inches from the broiler. In my oven, 3 minutes is perfect. But check after every minute to make sure they don&#39;t burn."
