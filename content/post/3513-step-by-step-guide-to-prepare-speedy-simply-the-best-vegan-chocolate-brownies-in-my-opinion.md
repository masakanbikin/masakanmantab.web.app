recipeinstructions:
- "Place oven rack in a low-middle position in the oven.  Heat oven to 180"
- "Line an 8” square tin with baking parchment."
- "Whiz the Black Beans and the vegetable margarine in a food processor until very smooth. Gradually add the oil, while continually processing."
- "Add the Syrup and Treacle, give a quick whizz to blend. The beans should have become fully amalgamated.  Add the melted chocolate to the bean mix, whiz again and turn out into a bowl.  Sift the flour, cocoa and baking powder together into a separate bowl and stir in the caster sugar."
- "Fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and then beat well.   The consistency should be a reluctant drop. Loosen with a touch more oil if needed.

- "Drag lines across the top in a close zig-zag. Sprinkle with the remaining chocolate callets."
- "Bake for 20 mins and then check the Brownie. Tip to one side to see if it moves slightly and also check to see if a cocktail stick stays clean when inserted.  It is likely it will need a further 5 mins. It should be soft but barely cooked in the middle.  Leave in the tin to cool completely. Cut once cooled. Serve with berries, Vegan ice-cream or a toffee sauce."
