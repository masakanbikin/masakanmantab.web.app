Add soy sauce around the edge of the wok, so it will burn slightly for the smoky umami flavor. You just need to perk things up with a little Southeast Asian flairâ€¦ We eat a lot of brown rice in our home, and Mix it up with chewy baked tofu, crunchy cashews, and the zesty flavors of lemongrass, ginger, lime, and cilantro, however, and we&#39;ll fight each other for the last bite. However, if you fry tofu, it gets a little crunchy and nutty tasting, almost like crisp chicken skin. The tofu absorbs some of the egg while lending its fattiness to reinforce that of the egg, as if it&#39;s an egg extender. Korean pajeons usually involve some rice flour and water.
