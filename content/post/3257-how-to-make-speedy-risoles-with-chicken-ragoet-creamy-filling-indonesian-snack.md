- "Start frying one side till its a bit brown, then fry the other side. It shouldn’t take long as its already cooked anyway. 1-2minutes of each side. And its done :) this can be eat on its own, or can be eat with chillies or sauces (example: dip in peanut sauce, chili sauce or my fave is mayonnaise mixed with chilly sauce (ABC brand)."
