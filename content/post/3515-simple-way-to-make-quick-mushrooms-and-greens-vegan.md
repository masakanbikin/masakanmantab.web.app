This vegan take does require some stove work to cook the oyster mushrooms, but once you toss them with jalapeÃ±o, cucumber, avocado, and onion, it won&#39;t taste any different from the marinated seafood. It will flatten the mushrooms and make sure the are being seared completely. When the mushrooms are crisp and meaty, serve up with rice, the greens and a sprinkle of sesame, spring onions &amp; drizzle of lime juice. The bitter, sour collard greens are sweetened with just a smidge of maple syrup at the end. Add the collard greens in large handfuls, pressing them down to wilt in the hot stock before adding more leaves.
