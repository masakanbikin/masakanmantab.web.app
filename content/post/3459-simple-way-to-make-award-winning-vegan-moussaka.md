Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, vegan moussaka ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Vegan Moussaka ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look fantastic. Vegan Moussaka ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· is something that I've loved my entire life.

This vegan moussaka is deliciously layered with baked eggplant, homemade vegan mince and a creamy vegan bechamel sauce. Vegan moussaka is like a lower carb version of a vegan shepherd&#39;s pie! Instead of mashed potatoes on the top you have bechamel sauce.

Vegan moussaka is just as tasty as the traditional one, but much healthier. I knew I can make a vegetarian ragu easily so that was a no-brainer, but the topping (rich bechamel sauce that traditionally relies on butter, milk and sometimes eggs) was going to be the tricky part. Layers of lentils with roasted vegetables, all topped with a creamy flavoursome sauce, this easy vegan moussaka is a winner. This post may contain affiliate links or sponsored content.
