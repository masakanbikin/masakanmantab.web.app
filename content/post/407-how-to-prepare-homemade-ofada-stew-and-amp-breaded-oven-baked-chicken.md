- "150  200ml palm oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Ok, First step is to season your chicken and leave to marinade anywhere from 3 hours to overnight. Then when that is all done, bring out your chicken and dip into egg, then into bread crumbs, then sprinkle coriander on it and toss into oven. (180 d.F for about 45 minutes. I prefer my meat not too moist, so I add little oil and tend to use a cloth to dab out the extra moisture in-between cooking)."
- "Boil your rice! done! moving on!"
- "Steam or sauté your vegetables! done! moving on! we’re making time here aren’t we? I LAV IT!"
- "Now, time for the stew we have all been waiting for. For your Ofada stew, cut up your Anaheim peppers and bell peppers and blend slightly rough in a blender, with some added water to help the peppers blend properly."
- "Once blended, get your pot/pan and put into it your blended mix, and leave on medium heat for a while, until the fluid has dried up and all you are left with is a dry pepper mix. This allows the pepper to really soak up the palm oil and seasonings and also, your stew does not have taste stolen from it by excess fluid. Refer to the image attached"
- "Now, in the same pan/pot or a new one if you’d like, add your palm oil and leave on medium heat for 5-6 minutes, it will start to smoke, don’t worry, this is just the bleaching process. Now add Iru and chopped onions and fry for about 5 minutes, (at this point, if you were doing it with assorted meat, this is where you would add them to fry, they will absorb the oil, but eventually release it back). After frying your Iru and onions for 5 minutes, add your crayfish, salt and other seasonings."
- "Leave to fry-cook for another 2 minutes, then add your dry pepper mix. The mix will cook just like if you were using meat, it will absorb the oil, cook, and then release it back to the top, once you start to see your oil rise to the top, it means your stew is ready. At this point, you can either take it off, dish it and eat it because you cannot wait any longer as the suspense is killing you and the family, or you could just cook it for 5 more minutes to darken more."
- "That is it, ladies and gentlemen, and your finished stew should look something like this"
- "Now go ahead and combine all and enjoy your meal. leave any comments below of what you think! your own recipes! how will you tweak this? do you have a way to make it better? or do you just want to tell me I am awesome!"
