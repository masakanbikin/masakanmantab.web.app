recipeingredient:
- "440 g chicken breast"
- " Golden breadcrumbs enough to coat chicken"
- " Dessicated coconut 13rd ratio to breadcrumbs"
- "1 tsp curry spice blend of your choice"
- " Salt for seasoning"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "On a plate mix together the golden breadcrumbs, dessicated coconut, a pinch of salt and curry powder. You want a ratio of 2/3rds breadcrumbs and 1/3rd coconut."
- "Butterfly out the chicken breasts into halves and trim off any fat/gristle. Slice the chicken into long thin flat gougons."
- "I find that wearing latex gloves helps with this next process, so the crumb coating doesn&#39;t stick to your fingers, or if you don&#39;t have any use some tongs. Take the pieces of chicken one by one and coat completely in the breadcrumb mix."
- "Preheat your oven to 180 (fan) and line a baking tray with foil and place a metal rack over it. Set aside. Heat up a frying pan with around 1.5tbsp oil in over a medium high heat. Once the oil is nice and hot, lay the chicken into the pan, carefully, and fry on both sides until golden. Remove from the heat."
- "Place onto the metal rack and bake in the oven for 20-25 mins until cooked right through. Serve up and enjoy! :)"
