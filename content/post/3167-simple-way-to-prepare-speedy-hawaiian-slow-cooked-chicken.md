I served this chicken over brown rice though white rice is just as good! Next time I make this I am going to serve on hamburger buns with macaroni salad. place chicken breasts in slow cooker, sprinkle with a little salt. place pineapple slices over chicken. combine pineapple juice, brown sugar, lemon juice, ginger, and cornstarch, stir until cornstarch mixes with liquids, pour over chicken.
