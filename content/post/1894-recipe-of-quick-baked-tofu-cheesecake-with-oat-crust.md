recipeingredient:
- " Oat Crust"
- "75 g (1/2 cup) all purpose flour"
- "45 g (1/2 cup) oat flour make your own by grinding rolled oats"
- "2 Tbsp almond flour make your own by grinding almonds"
- "2 Tbsp dark brown sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) butter melted"
- "2 Tbsp honey or maple syrup"
- " Filling"
- "300 g soft tofu 1 rectangular tube"
- "300 g (1 cup) neufchtel or cream cheese"
- "100 g (1/2 cup) plain yoghurt preferably greek yoghurt"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) butter melted"
- "100 g (1/2 cup) icing sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 Tbsp cornstarch"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/8 tsp salt"
- " Zest and juice of a lemon if you like lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Take the block of neufchâtel out of its box and let it warm on the counter while you prepare the crust, about 30 minutes."
- "Cut a large piece of foil and lay it on your work surface. Set the cake tin (i use 9x9 inch cake tin) in the middle and fold the edges of the foil up around the sides of the tin. The foil gives you extra protection against water getting into the pan during the water bath step."
- "Blend all the ingredients for the crust with a food processor. Press the mixture into the cake tin."
- "Place the crust in the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the crust is fragrant and just starting to brown around the edges. Let the crust cool on a cooling rack while you prepare the filling."
- "Blend all the ingredients for the filling with a food processor until smooth and creamy."
- "Check to make sure the crust and the sides of the pan are cool — if they&#39;re cool enough to comfortably touch, you can go on. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and spread it into an even layer against the sides of the pan."
- "Transfer the cake tin to a roasting pan or other baking dish big enough to hold it. Bring a few cups of water to a boil and pour the water into the roasting pan, being careful not to splash any water onto the cheesecake. Fill the pan to about an inch."
- "Bake the cheesecake at 350°F for 25 to 35 minutes. The cheesecake is done when the outer two to three inches look slightly puffed and set, but the inner circle still jiggles (like Jell-o) when you gently shake the pan."
- "Turn off the oven and crack the door open. Let the cheesecake cool slowly for one hour."
- "Chill the cheesecake, uncovered, for at least four hours or up to three days in the refrigerator. This step is crucial for letting the cheesecake set and achieving perfect cheesecake texture — don&#39;t rush it."
- "Serve the cheesecake cool, plain or with some fruits or preserves."
