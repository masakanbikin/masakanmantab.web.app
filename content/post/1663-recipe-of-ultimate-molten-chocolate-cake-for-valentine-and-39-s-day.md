recipeingredient:
- "180 grams Milk or semisweet Chocolate"
- "160 grams Butter Margarine"
- "80 grams Cake flour"
- "4 Egg ML"
- "100 grams Sugar"
- "10 grams Cocoa Powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 180°C."
- "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Melt the butter in the same way."
- "Break the eggs, add the sugar and whip until white. Soft peaks are fine, but I personally like stiff peaks better. It&#39;s easy if you have a hand mixer."
- "Add the butter little by little to the chocolate."
- "Keep mixing and it will become glossy."
- "Add the mixture from Step 3 bit by bit into the mixture from Step 4 and mix together. Try to mix thoroughly"
- "Sift the cocoa powder and flour into the Step 6 mixture. Mix until the dry ingredients are blended in."
- "Then, pour into the muffin cups and fill to 80% full. Bake in an oven preheated to 180ºC for 10-15 minutes. Once the tops have cracked a little, they&#39;re finished."
- "You know they are ready when a crack appears in the top. You may think that they are too soft, but if you bake them too long, they turn into regular chocolate cake. It&#39;s good if they&#39;re soft. If you cool them in the refrigerator, they will harden."
- "If you don&#39;t want them to crack, bake for 7 to 8 minutes until half-baked? I think that will be just right. There&#39;s a chance that they will continue cooking in residual heat while cooling."
- "You can sprinkle cocoa powder or powdered sugar if you like. If you eat them while they are hot and fresh, they&#39;ll be nice and creamy... Cooling them in the refrigerator and wrapping them to give as gifts is also a good idea. If you do that, add a message saying &#34;Warm in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating.&#34;"
- "The thick richness of the chocolate is addictive. It&#39;s best to chill them after they have cooled slightly from baking."
- "The baking time may vary a little depending on the oven. It appears that everyone is baking them for 10 minutes at 200ºC."
- "Please don&#39;t bake for more than 12 minutes. The chocolate won&#39;t be creamy if you bake for too long, and you also might think that they&#39;re too soft, but just take them out of the oven when the tops crack."
- "I used unsalted butter. I used muffin cups from the 100 yen shop to make these."
