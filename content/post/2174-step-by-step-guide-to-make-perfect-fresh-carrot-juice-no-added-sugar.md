recipeingredient:
- " Juice of 4 to 5 fresh oranges about 1 cup use measuring cup"
- "4 cups fresh carrots roughly chopped"
- "5-6 inch ginger peeled and roughly chopped or add to taste"
- "1/4-1/2 cup cold filtered water if needed"
- "1 pinch Black salt"
- "1 pinch Ground black pepper"
- " Ice cube as required"
- " For toppingoptional"
- " Some mint leaf 2 slice of lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "#If_using_a_juicer:   If using a juicer press all of the ingredients. You may not need to juice your oranges if you are using a juicer, but you will probably need to peel them and quarter them."
- "#If_using_a_blender:   Add the fresh squeezed orange juice a high speed blender and half of the carrots. Blend until all big chunks are gone. Add in the remaining carrots and the ginger, blend until no more chunks remain, add the water if needed to get the blender moving."
- "#Note:   you may be able to add all of the carrots and ginger at once if using a really high speed blender. For my medium quality blender doing half at a time works best."
- "#Strain_juice:   Place a thin kitchen tea towel over a large fine mesh strainer that is fitted over a large mixing bowl. Gather all corners of the towel and squeeze out the juice as best as you can. Discard the carrot pulp or use in a carrot cake."
- "#Drink:   Transfer the juice to a drinking glass and enjoy immediately. I like to add a salt, pepper with few ice cubes to my juice to make it cold, but not a ton so it doesn&#39;t water it down. Store any leftover juice in an air tight container in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours. The vitamins and health benefits of the juice will diminish after 12 to 24 hours, so it&#39;s best when fresh."
- "#Notes:  In a hurry you could use some good quality orange juice instead of juicing your own but I recommend fresh orange juice.  No add sugar in this recipe because carrots &amp; oranges have a natural sweetness."
