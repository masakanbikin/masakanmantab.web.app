Divide polenta among bowls and top with mushrooms, thyme leaves, sea salt, and more Parmesan. Bought a TON of mushrooms, and wasn&#39;t shy with the olive oil or thyme - in the spirit of quarantine cooking I had some odds and ends i threw in with the shrooms - lil butternut, a couple. We&#39;ve already seen Angelina&#39;s southern Italian style meatloaf, stuffed with mozzarella and baked in the oven with potatoes. In this version, the meatloaf is browned and braised on top of the stove, the more usual technique among Italians. The initial browning does require a bit of dexterity to avoid the loaf.
