- "In a skillet over medium heat, drizzle in some sesame oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the chicken mixture.  Immediately, rinse the bowl with 1/4 cup of warm water.  Pour the water mixture into the skillet with the chicken.  Cover and cook for 7 to 8 mins.  *Check at 5 mins mark to prevent any burning. The chicken breast should be cooked thru&#39; with tender juiciness and not tough and dry.*"
- "Remove from heat and set aside.  Once you have rolled out your pizza dough, brush the dough with sesame oil using a pastry brush.   *Remember to use a fork and gently poke all over. This is crucial as it will prevent the crust from puffing.*"
- "In a griddle over medium heat, gently place in the dough oiled side down.   Carefully and gently, using your hands to press down the dough to make sure the whole dough sits fully on the griddle.   Brush the top with sesame oil.   Grill until almost charred.   Flip the dough.   Immediately turn the heat down to medium-low."
- "Spread the spicy chicken over the pizza dough evenly. When you think it is not enough, it is enough. Less is always more.  Sprinkle mozzarella over the top, distributing them evenly. Again, less is more.  Immediately cover the griddle to generate steam so that the cheese will melt.   As soon as the cheese melts and the bottom is charred, remove the cover.   Remove the pizza from heat and transfer onto a serving plate."
- "Immediately. scatter scallions and black sesame over the top.  Repeat the steps for the remaining pizzas.   Slice and serve immediately."

I call this fire chicken &#34;Korean pizza&#34;. It features chunky, juicy chicken swamped in a chili sauce with chewy rice cakes and melty cheese. I had never heard of Korean Cheese Buldak, or Fire Chicken, until I came across it in a recipe by Maangchi. It&#39;s one of my favorite Korean blogs and my go-to place.

This Korean bar snack will make you forget all about Buffalo wings. During initial rounds of testing, I couldn&#39;t quite get my buldak sauce to the shiny glaze consistency that I wanted. I tried adding a touch more rice syrup, but that made the sauce too sweet. My least favorite flavor in the whole samyang ramen line. It&#39;s honestly wonderful, but beware it is so spicy!
