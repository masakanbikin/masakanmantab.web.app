Thanks to Nandos, Piri Piri chicken is now seriously popular although I&#39;ve loved this Portuguese marinade for a long time! It&#39;s well worth making extra because you&#39;ll want to cover everything with it! Place a large heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. I have no idea what&#39;s on the menu at the (highly recommended should you find yourself in the Algarve) Teodósio O Rei Dos Frangos, we never even read it, but on every table there was a pile of grilled chicken, fried potatoes and a tomato onion. Chicken is marinated in a spicy piri piri pepper sauce, then grilled for this simple but flavorful African-inspired recipe.
