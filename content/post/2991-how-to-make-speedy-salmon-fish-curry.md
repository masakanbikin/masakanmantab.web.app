Eating fish head curry is an acquired taste - it is either you love it or loathe it. Add fish to boiling curry and slow down flame to medium low. Cover the pan and let simmer medium low flame. Marinate the salmon fillets in roughly half the contents of the curry paste for an hour or two. If the fish has skin attached I like to leave it on and fry the skin side until it is quite crispy, that&#39;s the Thai way so down to.
