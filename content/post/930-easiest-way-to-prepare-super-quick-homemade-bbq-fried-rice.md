recipeingredient:
- "250 g day old rice or konjac rice"

- " To Garnish"
- " Crispy dried onions can be found in most supermarkets"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a wok up over a high heat and spray the base liberally with oil. Once nice and hot add in the onions and fry for a couple of minutes, then add in the rice. Stir fry for another minute or two."
- "Season well with salt and pepper. Add in the sweetcorn. Stir fry for a minute then pour in the beans. Stir and spread out evenly over the wok and allow some of the sauce from the beans to evaporate from the rice."
- "Add the pulled pork (or veggie alternative), by scattering it over evenly. Toss everything together. Add in 2 tbsp of the BBQ sauce and toss together once more."
- "Once the rice isn&#39;t sloppy in consistency, and it&#39;s not too wet turn out into a serving plate, (the key to good fried rice is that the rice isn&#39;t too wet, keep moving it around the wok until enough moisture evaporates, ensuring the rice doesn&#39;t catch), and drizzle over the remaining bbq sauce and garnish with some crispy onions. Enjoy!"
