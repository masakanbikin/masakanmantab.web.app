recipeinstructions:
- "Mix it all together in a bowl. Add the water last, a little at a time. Depending on your flour you might not be able to get that much water to absorb into the dough, so just add add much as you can."
- "Knead it a bit. I try to stretch the fibers by rolling the dough into a sausage shape and then folding in half. Repeat. I believe that this helps the gluten to align in one direction kind of like muscle fibers. That&#39;s just a guess though."

- "Slice the dough into 4 chicken breast sized pieces (mine has quite an authentic raw meat texture at this point) and marinade in a BBQ sauce of your choosing (about 1 hour marinade worked for me, but longer is always better)."
- "Grill it on the BBQ. Brush more BBQ sauce into the steaks as they are cooking. Slice into strips. Dip the strips in more sauce if required. Add to pizza/fajitas/bibimbap etc."
