recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 220°C"
- "To make the pizza dough: combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined. Then knead the dough with your hands, adding a sprinkle of more flour or water if needed until you have a smooth, firm dough."
- "Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest about 20 minutes."
- "To make the BBQ cauliflower: add the cauliflower florets to a parchment lined baking tray."
- "To a small bowl, add the BBQ sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder, and stir to combine. Pour half of the sauce over the florets, and toss to coat. Reserve the other half of the BBQ sauce for later."
- "Spread out the BBQ florets evenly on the baking tray, and bake in the oven for 20 minutes, flipping once half way."

- "Divide and distribute the BBQ cauliflower florets over top of both pizzas."
- "Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden, stopping to flip the position of the pizzas in the oven once at the halfway point."
- "To make the garlic yogurt sauce: combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a bowl, and stir to combine."
- "When the pizzas are ready, drizzle some of the garlic yogurt sauce on top, and sprinkle over the sliced scallion."
