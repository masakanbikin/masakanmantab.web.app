recipeingredient:
- "900 ml water slightly warm"
- "16 g dry yeast"
- "2 tsp salt"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1000 g gluten free flour or plain 500 g at the beginning and 500 g later"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place 900 ml of slightly warm water in a bowl, add the olive oil, about two packets of yeast and dissolve it. Let it sit for a while (5 minutes) and then add the 500 g of flour. Mix using a whisk (always)."
- "Set it aside for a while and then add the salt and the remaining 500 g of flour. Whisk well."
- "Dust a baking pan with flour and place the mixture in it. Let it sit until the yeast starts to get activated and the dough rises. Preheat the oven to 250oC. Take a Dutch oven or a baking pan with a lid and line it with greaseproof paper. Remove it and place the pan in the preheated oven. When the dough has risen, sprinkle with seeds and fold with the help of a spatula. Turn the dough little by little as if you are going to fold it and sprinkle some more. When the oven reaches the desired temperature, take out the Dutch oven, line it with the greaseproof paper that you have prepared and pour in the fluffy, slightly runny mixture. Sprinkle with the seeds that you like (I used sesame seeds, millet flakes, poppy seeds and anise). Sprinkle with olive oil."
- "Cover with the equally hot lid of the Dutch oven and place it in the oven at 250oC. Half an hour later, lower to 220oC. Bake for an additional half hour (1 hour total). Switch off the oven and open the door. Take out the Dutch oven without removing the lid. If you do, it will be more dry. Cut the bread after it has cooled thoroughly. Best of luck!"
