recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 180. Boil a large pan of water."
- "Beat Mascarpone, gradually add the milk and beat together. Add a couple of grinds of nutmeg and white pepper to taste and 2/3rds of the grated Parmesan. Warm gently in a large, chefs pan (which will hold the gnocchi in a single layer) and then remove from the heat once the Parmesan has begun to melt."
- "Heat a large frying pan. Oil both sides of the Pork loin chops. Place the chops into the hot frying pan and leave to caramelise to a good brown colour. Only turn over once the colour has formed on one side. Don’t be tempted to move the chops around, this will cause them to cool down and steam and then they will not go brown."

- "Cook the Gnocchi according to the packet instructions in the boiling water, drain and add to cream mixture. Turn gently to coat."

- "Melt the butter in a small pan and gently heat the sage leaves for a few minutes until crispy. Remove from the heat. Allow to infuse."
- "After 10 minutes, check the Pork to see if it is cooked. If it is, remove it from the oven to rest and keep warm, if not cook a few minutes longer, then allow to rest."
- "While the meat rests, pop the Gnocchi under the grill until golden and bubbling."
- "Serve, pouring the Sage butter and crispy Sage leaves over the Pork. Some fresh green veg goes well to balance out the richness."
