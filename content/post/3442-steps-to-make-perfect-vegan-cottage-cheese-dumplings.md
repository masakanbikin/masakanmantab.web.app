Use it as a dip for veggies or with fresh strawberries. My favorite way to use it is on bread though with lots of fresh herbs. I didn&#39;t use nearly as much fresh herbs in these pictures as I actually. This vegan cottage cheese is a wonderful replacement for its dairy counterpart, mimicking the texture with harder curds and a softer &#39;sauce&#39; and a neutral flavor. I always used to love cottage cheese and I only just found a good vegan alternative.
