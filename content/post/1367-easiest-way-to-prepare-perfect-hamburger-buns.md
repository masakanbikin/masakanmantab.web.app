- "235 ml warm water"
- "45 ml lukewarm milk"
- "10 g dry yeast"
- "35 g white sugar"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "375 g bread flour"
- "42 g all purpose flour"

- "15 ml water"
- "1 egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a small bowl, combine the water, sugar, milk, and yeast. Let rest until bubbly."
- "In a separate, large bowl, whisk together the bread flour, all purpose flour, and salt. Then, add the butter and use your fingers to ‘crumble’ it."
- "Combine the yeast mixture and flour mixture together and add the egg, and mix until a dough forms."
- "Scrape the dough onto an unfloured surface and knead it for 5-7 minutes, with the help of a dough scraper. Even though the dough is sticky, resist flouring the dough and/or surface."
- "Transfer the dough into a greased bowl and cover with cling wrap or a lid. Let proof for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled."
- "Divide the proofed dough into 8 equal parts and start shaping them into balls. If the dough is still sticky, you can use a bit of flour."
- "Line them onto a baking tray with a sheet of parchment paper, about 5cm apart. Then, cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for another 1-2 hours."
- "Once dough has doubled in size, use egg wash to brush the buns. Optionally, sprinkle sesame seeds to taste. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 400F/200°C. Then, place a shallow pan of water in the bottom of the oven. If your oven is a steam oven (like ours), there is no need to do this."
- "Bake the buns for about 15 minutes. Turn the baking sheet around halfway through baking (at around 7-8 minutes)."
- "Cut the hamburger buns in half and toast with butter for a delicious burger!"
