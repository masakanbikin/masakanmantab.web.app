Pick up one half and brush it with a little water along the straight edge of the pastry."
- "Now take one edge of the straight side, and place it on the other edge of the straight side in such a way that the dough forms into a cone shape.Pinch the corner of the cone so that its sealed.

- "Brush the inside of the unfilled dough with a little water and seal it by pinching the edge together. Repeat till all the dough is used up. Place the samosas on a greased tray making sure they don’t touch each other and cover them with a damp cloth."
- "Heat oil in a pan. To test if the oil is hot enough, add a tiny piece of dough to the oil and if it bubbles and floats on the surface, your oil is ready for frying. Add the samosas to the oil making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and reduce the flame to a simmer."
- "Fry the samosas on a low flame till golden brown on both side. Its important to fry them on a low flame, or the pastry would be raw from the inside and golden brown on the outside. Take them out on a plate lined with paper to absorb any extra oil and serve them immediately with ketchup / chutney."

Samosas are prepared differently throughout the Indian subcontinent but the essence is the same: a fried pastry with a spicy savoury filling. This Pakistani version my mom makes is spicier, has a thicker crust, and is more tetrahedral than its Indian counterpart. Fill classic Indian samosas, with a lively spiced potato and pea filling; then serve with a tangy cilantro-mint chutney. Making Indian samosas, triangular fried pastries filled with peas and potatoes, is nothing like crafting delicate French pastry.
