Hash, much like using the slow cooker today, was a dish created where everything was put in the pot and cooked for hours with an occasional stir. I remember when I was very young, my mom and dad used to wake me up early Saturday or Sunday morning to watch my younger brothers, so that they could go to Chinatown and pick up some dim Sum, pork hash and manapua for breakfast. I grew up eating these wonderful chinese foods. While it was a big hit at the party, we did have some left over.
