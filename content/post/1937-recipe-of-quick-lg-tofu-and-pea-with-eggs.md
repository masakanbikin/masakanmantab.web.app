A quick stir-fry of green peas and green onions with ground pork and tofu makes a delicious topping for a warm bowl of rice. I substituted the peas for broccoli florets. Eggplant and tofu are fantastic together; the tofu holds its shape, the eggplant collapses and partly joins the sauce and the result was too dark and pretty to even bother garnishing with chiles or scallions, but you could. Remember when I got to interview him? I also made this tomato egg stir-fry countless times in college when I got home late from class or practice, and I wanted something quick and on the cheap, with ingredients I already had available.
