Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are part of the legume family. While they have become more popular recently, chickpeas have been grown in Middle Eastern countries for thousands of years. Chickpeas are a common ingredient in many dishes in Pakistan where I grew up. I incorporate the tastes of my home country when cooking for my American-born daughters.

I have combined the light spice of Pakistani foods with the love of deep-fried finger foods that many Americans, including my daughters, enjoy. Chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans, ceci, and bengal gram) are loved around the globe. Canned or dried, they&#39;ve got a prime spot in our pantry. These nutritional overachievers are chock-full of fiber. Made this chickpea recipe, exactly as written, and ended up w/ black pebbles and a lingering burnt aroma.
