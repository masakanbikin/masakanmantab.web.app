- " potatoes"
- "1/2 tsp dry ground ginger"
- " salt pepper oregano"
- " juice of one lemon"
- " mustard"
- "1 cup olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Ask your butcher for three small pork shanks and ask them to clean them so that it saves you time and effort at home! If you like you can marinate them from the previous evening after you have washed them well, in a marinade using a cup of wine, one carrot, quartered, one pepper cut in half, an onion, one clove of garlic, ginger cut into thick slices, pepper and allspice."
- "If you don&#39;t want to marinate them (it is equally delicious), then wash them well, rub them with salt and pepper and place them with all the ingredients mentioned above as well as 1/4 cup olive oil into a Dutch oven. Put the lid on and bake at 160°C for about two hours, checking if you need to turn the shanks over and add some wine. If you like the dish to be slightly sweet add the juice of half an orange. The secret lies in not using any water."
- "Peel and cut the potatoes in a large bowl. If you have small round potatoes it looks even better. Add salt, oregano, one clove of garlic cut into very thin slices, dry ground ginger, lemon juice, a tsp of mustard, one cup olive oil and mix all the ingredients."
- "Take the lid off, take out the spices and vegetables except the bay leaf, using a sifter ladle and spread the potatoes around the shanks. Put the lid back on and let it cook at the same temperature for 1 1/2 hour. Just before you remove it from the oven and if you like it crispy as I do, take off the lid and raise the temperature to 180-190°C so that all the liquids evaporate and only the oil remains."
