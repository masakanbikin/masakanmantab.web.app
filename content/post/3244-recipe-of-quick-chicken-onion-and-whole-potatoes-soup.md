Chicken and Potato Chowder - Just like mom&#39;s comforting chicken noodle soup, but it&#39;s even creamier and loaded with cheesy goodness! I could always use a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Chicken pot pie is ultimate comfort food and this creamy, chunky soup is loaded with chicken, potatoes, mushrooms, peas, carrots, corn, celery, onions and green beans in every bite. It&#39;s also great with leftover turkey, as I do here in this Turkey Pot Pie Soup recipe.
