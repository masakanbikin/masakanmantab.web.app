recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "2 tbsp allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup milk"
- "1 1/2 cup leftover turkey gravy"
- "2 cup leftover turkey  roughly chopped"
- "2/3 cup frozen peas and carrots mix or any leftover veggies you may have cut to 14in dice"
- "2 cup to 4 cup leftover mashed potatoes"
- "1 cup leftover stuffingdressing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425°F. Grease a 9in round deep dish pie plate or a deep sided 8x8in square casserole dish. Press cold, leftover stuffing/dressing into the bottom and slightly up the sides to form a bottom &#34;crust&#34;. Bake in oven for 5 min. Remove and set aside (leave oven on)."
- "Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add butter when hot. When melted whisk in flour. Cook about 2 minutes to make a nice golden roux. Add milk, whisking to combine and keep from clumping. Stir in leftover gravy and veggies. Bring to a simmer for about 2 minutes to heat through. Turn off heat, add leftover turkey and stir gently to combine."
- "Reheat mashed potatoes in a microwave safe bowl for 1-2 minutes in microwave, or until just heated through so they will be easier to work with."
- "Gently pour filling into stuffing crust. Starting at the edges, dollop mashed potatoes in several little mounds all over the top. I actually have a tablespoon sized ice cream scoop that works perfectly for this, and makes the cutest little mounds of potato. You could even use a star tip on a piping bag. Get fancy with it!"
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes or until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from oven. Let rest 5 - 10 minutes and enjoy a simple and easy day after Thanksgiving meal!"
- "Optional: remove from oven at 20 minutes, top with 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and return to oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and beginning to turn golden brown."
