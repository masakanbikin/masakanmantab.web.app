I confess that I didn&#39;t like Membrillo (pronounced mem-BREE-yo) the first time I tried it. Membrillo, as the quince is called in Spanish, is cooked into a reddish, jelly-like block or firm, reddish paste known as dulce de mambrillo and eaten in sandwiches or paired with their famous Manchego Cheese: a scintillating pairing.
