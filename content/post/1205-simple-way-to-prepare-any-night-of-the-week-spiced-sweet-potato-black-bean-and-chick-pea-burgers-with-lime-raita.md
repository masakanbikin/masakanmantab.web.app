recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oven to 200 degrees C. Pop the washed and pricked sweet potatoes into the oven and bake until soft, about 30 - 40 minutes. Or for speed, pop into a microwave, cook for 12 minutes on high and then finish in the hot oven for 15 mins."
- "Place the beans and chickpeas into a pan along with the stock and Bayleaf. Just cover with boiling water, season and simmer for 15 mins or until the stock has reduced."
- "While the beans and chickpeas are simmering, prep the onion, pepper, garlic and spices. I like to put my spices, seasoning and herbs onto a small plate and then blend together"
- "Heat a frying pan, add a splash of rapeseed oil and then sauté the onions until golden, add the garlic, heat gently for 1 minute, add the red pepper, stir, add the herbs and spices, season and cook gently for 10 minutes or until soft."

- "Drain the beans and chickpeas and pulse gently in a food processor. It&#39;s important not to over process and to have some texture. If you don&#39;t have a food processor, mash with a fork or potato masher or chop roughly with a knife. Then thoroughly mix the beans, chickpeas, sweet potato mash and onion mixture together. Taste and adjust seasoning and spicing if required."
- "Place half a pack of Panko breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl, add the spices and herbs and mix together. Take a large tablespoon of the burger mixture and put it onto the breadcrumb mix. Form into patties an cover with breadcrumbs. Once all of the burgers are formed chill for 30 mins in the &#39;fridge to firm up a bit. It&#39;s not essential to chill if you&#39;re in a hurry."
- "Bake the burgers in the oven at 180 degrees C approx 20 mins or shallow fry in hot Rapeseed oil until brown and crisp, approx 5 mins each side. Serve with a wedge of Lime, some Yoghurt blended with juice of half a Lime to make a Lime Raita and some veg of your choice a green salad or in a bun with some salsa, mozzarella and salad leaves. Enjoy."
