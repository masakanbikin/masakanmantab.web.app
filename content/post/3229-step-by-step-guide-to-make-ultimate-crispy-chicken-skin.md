Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, crispy chicken skin. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

##### The ingredients needed to make Crispy Chicken Skin:

1. Get  A. Chicken skin
1. Prepare  B. Coating
1. Get 1/4 C plain flour
1. Make ready 1/4 C rice flour
1. Get 1/4 C corn flour
1. Take 2 tsp garlic powder
1. Prepare 2 tsp chicken seasoning powder or salt to taste
1. Make ready 1 tsp ground white pepper - optional
1. Take  Chili powder- optional
1. Get  C. Cooking oil for frying


Drain and transfer to a cutting board. An absolute must is NOT touching the chicken once it&#39;s on the skillet. You&#39;ll either rip the skin prematurely (sad!) or become too impatient and flip your chicken before it has reached its full, crispy potential (even sadder!). Flatten, flesh side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Coating the chicken in baking powder and salt before cooking produced an intensely crispy skinâ€”at first. This helps get the skin crispy. This allows the hot air to circulate around the oven baked chicken legs. The baked chicken legs oven temp is high, but this helps crisp up the skin.
