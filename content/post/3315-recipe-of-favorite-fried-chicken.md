- "2 chicken breasts"
- " Marinade"
- "1 tsp tumeric"
- "3 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp rice wine vinegar"
- "1 tsp coriander powder"
- "1 tsp sriracha"
- "1 tsp cumin"
- "1/4 tsp ground cloves"
- "1/4 tsp smoked paprika"

- " Nigella seeds"
- " Sunflower oil"
- "50 g Cornflour"
- "50 g Self raising flour"
- " Sauce"
- "4 tbsp honey"
- "2 tbsp soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the ingredients in the marinade section in a Ziploc bag. Slice your breast into bite size pieces and add it to the bag. Marinade in the fridge for one hour."
- "Take the chicken out and pick out the pieces, making sure not to take out too much of the liquid from the chicken or marinade. DO NOT PAT THE CHICKEN DRY. Combine the self raising flour and cornflour in a bowl, and toss the chicken through. If you need more flour just add a tablespoon extra at a time of each flour."
- "Fill a large frying pan with sunflower oil, about half an inch up the side of the pan. Heat the oil until it shimmers, and when you dip a chopstick in the oil, it instantly fizzes."
- "Place enough chicken breast pieces in the pan so you&#39;re maximising space, but the breast still needs a little room around it as the flour expands. After around a minute on one side, flip the breasts. Continue this process until all the breast is crisped up, and keep it on a plate with a paper towel to soak up excess oil."
- "Heat the oven to 180C and spread the chicken across a baking sheet. Meanwhile combine the ingredients in the &#39;sauce&#39; section."
- "Bake the breast slices for 5 minutes, until a dark golden colour and awfully crispy."
- "Drizzle over the sauce to make them sticky on the outside, then crispy crust, then the moist and perfectly cooked breast inside."
- "Place the breast pieces in a bowl and garnish with nigella seeds. Enjoy!"
