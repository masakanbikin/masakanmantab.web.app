recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350. Pound the chops out with a mallet. until they&#39;re between 1/4 and 1/2 inches thick (If you don&#39;t have a mallet, a rolling pin will work). Rub seasoning into the chops."
- "Get three shallow bowls and put flour in the first, eggs in the second, and bread crumbs in the third. Season the eggs if desired and break up the yolk."
