recipeingredient:
- " Beef steak cut to 1 inch thick"
- " Mayonnaise"
- " Salt Preferably coarse"
- " Black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "If steak is frozen, defrost overnight in the fridge. Pat dry the defrosted steak then salt on all sides (depending on thickness of steak) and leave in the fridge for 1-3 hours."
- "Fill half of the BBQ chimney starter with charcoal briquettes (not lumpwood) and light as per normal procedure. Place a grill grate on top as this will be the cooking surface."
- "Whilst the charcoals heat up, remove steak from the fridge and pat dry. Then cover with a moderate but translucent layer of mayonnaise on all sides"
- "Once the charcoals are white and glowing hot. Place steak onto grill grate. Flip the steak every 20-30 seconds and repeat until 2-3 minutes have elapsed. The thicker the steak the the longer the cooking time, but be wary of burning the beautiful crust that will form on the outside."
- "Finish off by searing the sides of the steak and then removing from the heat. Allow the steak to rest for 3-5 minutes prior to slicing, otherwise the moisture will flood out leaving a dry and tough steak! Grind pepper to finish as preferred"
